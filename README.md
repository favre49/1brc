# 1brc

## What Is It?

A C++ solution to the [1 Billion Row Challenge](https://1brc.dev/) using AVX SIMD intrinsics. Run this by creating an input file named `measurements.txt` and running:
```
make measure
```

The current mean runtime on my machine is ~300 ms on a 100 million row test set.

## Caveats

- This implementation has only been tested and measured on inputs generated by the [official generator](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc). The number of station names is only about 400 and the names are generally quite small, and this implementation is somewhat optimized for that.
- This implementation has only been tested on a 100 million row test set, since my machine has only 8 GB RAM which is too small to fit the full 1 billion row test set in memory.
